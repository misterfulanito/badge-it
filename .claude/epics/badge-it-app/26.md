# Task: Remove Stepper and Multi-Step Flow

## Description
Remove the stepper navigation component and all multi-step flow logic from the application. The app will become a single-page experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove AppStepper component from index.vue
- [ ] Remove step state management (currentStep, AppStep type)
- [ ] Remove step-based conditional rendering
- [ ] Delete AppStepper.vue component file
- [ ] Remove step-related functions (backToUpload, backToBadges, proceedToPreview)
- [ ] Clean up unused imports

## Files to Modify
- `pages/index.vue` - Remove stepper usage and step logic
- `components/AppStepper.vue` - Delete file

## Technical Notes
- The page will always show the main content (no step switching)
- State will be simpler: hasImage, selectedBadge, badgePosition, badgeSize

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5-1
