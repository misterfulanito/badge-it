# Task: Toast Notifications

## Description
Implement centralized toast notifications using PrimeVue Toast component. Create a composable for consistent toast messaging across all components for errors, success, and info messages.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PrimeVue Toast configured in app.vue
- [ ] useToastMessages composable created
- [ ] Error toasts display with red/error styling
- [ ] Success toasts display with green/success styling
- [ ] Info toasts display with blue/info styling
- [ ] Toasts auto-dismiss after appropriate duration
- [ ] Toasts can be manually dismissed
- [ ] All error scenarios from PRD have toast messages

## Technical Details
- **Component**: Toast in `app.vue`
- **Composable**: `composables/useToastMessages.ts`

### App Setup
```vue
<!-- app.vue -->
<template>
  <Toast position="top-right" />
  <NuxtPage />
</template>
```

### Toast Composable
```typescript
// composables/useToastMessages.ts
import { useToast } from 'primevue/usetoast'

export const useToastMessages = () => {
  const toast = useToast()

  const showError = (message: string, detail?: string) => {
    toast.add({
      severity: 'error',
      summary: message,
      detail,
      life: 5000
    })
  }

  const showSuccess = (message: string, detail?: string) => {
    toast.add({
      severity: 'success',
      summary: message,
      detail,
      life: 3000
    })
  }

  const showInfo = (message: string, detail?: string) => {
    toast.add({
      severity: 'info',
      summary: message,
      detail,
      life: 4000
    })
  }

  return { showError, showSuccess, showInfo }
}
```
