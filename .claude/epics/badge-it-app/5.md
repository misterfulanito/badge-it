# Task: Badge Library Component

## Description
Create the BadgeLibrary component that displays a grid of predefined badge options. Users can select one badge at a time, with visual indication of the selected badge. Include ability to remove/deselect the current badge.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Displays grid of badge thumbnails
- [ ] Badges loaded from /public/badges/ directory
- [ ] Only one badge can be selected at a time
- [ ] Selected badge has clear visual indicator (border/highlight)
- [ ] Clicking selected badge deselects it (removes badge)
- [ ] Clicking different badge replaces current selection
- [ ] Error toast if badge fails to load
- [ ] Responsive grid (4 columns desktop, 3 on tablet, 2 on mobile)

## Technical Details
- **Component**: `components/BadgeLibrary.vue`
- **Composable**: `composables/useBadges.ts`
- **Assets**: `/public/badges/*.png`

### Badge Data Structure
```typescript
// composables/useBadges.ts
interface Badge {
  id: string
  name: string
  category: string
  src: string // Path to PNG file
}

const badges: Badge[] = [
  { id: 'hiring', name: 'Hiring', category: 'professional', src: '/badges/hiring.png' },
  { id: 'open-to-work', name: 'Open to Work', category: 'professional', src: '/badges/open-to-work.png' },
  // ... more badges
]
```

### Component Structure
```vue
<template>
  <div class="badge-library">
    <div
      v-for="badge in badges"
      :key="badge.id"
      :class="['badge-item', { selected: selectedBadge?.id === badge.id }]"
      @click="toggleBadge(badge)"
    >
      <img :src="badge.src" :alt="badge.name" />
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```
