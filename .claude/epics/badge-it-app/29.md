# Task: Update Badge Options with Disabled State

## Description
Modify the badge options (selection, position, size) to be disabled until an image is uploaded. Add helpful copy to guide users.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All badge options disabled when no image uploaded
- [ ] Visual indication of disabled state (opacity, cursor)
- [ ] Add copy: "Upload an image to enable badge options"
- [ ] Options become active immediately after image upload
- [ ] Remove "Want more badges?" info text from UI
- [ ] Maintain collapsible section behavior

## Disabled State Visual
```css
.options-column--disabled {
  opacity: 0.5;
  pointer-events: none;
}

.options-disabled-message {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 1rem;
  color: var(--text-color-muted);
}
```

## Copy
When disabled: "Upload an image first to customize your badge"

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5-1
