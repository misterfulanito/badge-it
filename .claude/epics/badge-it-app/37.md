# Task: Protect Badges Folder and Create Documentation

## Description
Secure the /public/badges/ folder from directory listing and create documentation for adding new badges.

## Security Measures

### 1. Prevent Directory Listing
Create `public/badges/.htaccess` (for Apache):
```
Options -Indexes
```

Or configure in `nuxt.config.ts` for Vercel/other hosts.

### 2. Add Index File
Create `public/badges/index.html` that redirects to home:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;url=/" />
</head>
<body>
  <p>Redirecting...</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Documentation

Create `public/badges/README.md`:
```markdown
# Adding Badges to Badge It

## File Requirements
- Format: PNG with transparent background
- Size: 512x512 pixels (recommended)
- Naming: lowercase, hyphens, no spaces
  - Example: `verified-badge.png`, `hiring-now.png`

## How to Add a Badge
1. Create your badge image (512x512 PNG, transparent bg)
2. Name it descriptively: `badge-name.png`
3. Place it in this folder: `/public/badges/`
4. The badge will automatically appear in the app

## Naming Convention
- Use lowercase letters
- Use hyphens (-) instead of spaces
- Keep names short but descriptive
- Examples:
  - ✅ `open-to-work.png`
  - ✅ `hiring-badge.png`
  - ❌ `Open To Work.png`
  - ❌ `badge_1.png`

## Badge Design Tips
- Use transparent backgrounds
- Keep designs simple and recognizable
- Test at small sizes (the badge may appear as small as 200px)
- Use bold colors that stand out on photos
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Directory listing disabled for /public/badges/
- [ ] Fallback index.html redirects to home
- [ ] README.md with clear instructions
- [ ] Naming conventions documented
- [ ] Design tips included

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 0.5
