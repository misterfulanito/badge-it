# Task: Remove Toast for Success Actions

## Description
Remove toast notifications for success actions (like download complete). Keep toasts only for error states.

## Current Toast Usage
- `downloadSuccess()` - REMOVE
- `downloadFailed()` - KEEP
- `changesCleared()` - Already removed
- Upload errors - KEEP

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Remove success toast after download
- [ ] Keep error toasts (download failed, upload failed, invalid file)
- [ ] Remove unused toast functions from composable
- [ ] Clean up useToastMessages composable if needed

## Files to Modify
- `pages/index.vue` - Remove downloadSuccess() call
- `composables/useToastMessages.ts` - Remove unused functions

## Rationale
Success actions are self-evident (file downloads, image appears). Toasts should only interrupt for errors requiring user attention.

## Effort Estimate
- Size: XS
- Hours: 0.25
