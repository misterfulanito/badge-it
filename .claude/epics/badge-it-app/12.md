# Task: Horizontal Stepper Component

## Description
Create a horizontal progress indicator showing the user's position in the 4-step workflow (Upload → Crop → Badge → Preview). The stepper should show completed steps with checkmarks, current step highlighted, and future steps outlined.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 4 steps displayed horizontally: Upload, Crop, Badge, Preview
- [ ] Current step is highlighted with primary color
- [ ] Completed steps show checkmark icon and are faded (opacity 0.7)
- [ ] Future steps are outlined with muted text
- [ ] Clicking completed steps navigates back to that step
- [ ] Connector lines between steps
- [ ] Responsive design (smaller on mobile)
