# Task: Integrate Upload/Crop into Left Column

## Description
Adapt the UploadCropper component to work in the left column with enhanced features for image management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Default state: dotted upload box (1:1 ratio)
- [ ] Drag & drop functionality preserved
- [ ] Click to upload functionality preserved
- [ ] Zoom controls for cropping (increase/decrease size)
- [ ] "Change Photo" button triggers OS file browser
- [ ] "Remove Image" button returns to empty state
- [ ] Show preview with badge overlay when image loaded
- [ ] Keep "This is how your image will look" legend
- [ ] Maintain best quality (1024x1024 output)

## Component Changes
The left column should show:
1. **No image**: Upload area with dotted border
2. **Image loaded**:
   - Preview canvas with badge overlay
   - Zoom controls (slider + buttons)
   - "Change Photo" and "Remove Image" buttons
   - Helper text

## Technical Notes
- "Change Photo" should use hidden file input click
- "Remove Image" clears image state and shows upload area
- Cropper zoom should support large/rectangular images
- Preview shows real-time badge overlay

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 1.5-2
